1. Project Overview and Goals
Goal:
Develop a lightweight, modular backend system—called the MCP Server—that aggregates and normalizes content from various sources (news articles, research PDFs, Twitter feeds, emails, and manual uploads). The system must:

Centralize and Store Content: Keep all content in one place with metadata for source, topic, and date.

Enable Search and Analysis: Allow full‐text search, filtering by date, source, and tag.

Expose Functionality as Tools via MCP: Implement a standardized interface (MCP: Model Context Protocol) so LLMs and AI assistants can call functions (tools) such as “search,” “list,” or “summarize.”

Maintain Modularity and Privacy: Stay lightweight, extensible, and secure.

MCP Focus:
MCP (Model Context Protocol) acts as a “universal connector” between external tools and language models. Instead of an ad hoc REST API, your server will expose functions in a standardized, JSON‐RPC–like format so that any compliant AI agent can call tools (like “list_files,” “search_content,” etc.) and receive consistent, structured responses.

2. Architectural Design
High-Level Components:

Data Ingestion Layer:

Web Content: Scrapers or API integrations for WSJ, The Economist, ProQuest, and research libraries.

Twitter Feed: Use APIs (or scraping tools) for tweets, retweets, likes, and replies.

Email Processing: Parse forwarded newsletters using services like Mailgun, Postmark, or direct Gmail API integration.

Manual Uploads: Endpoints to receive plaintext, markdown, or PDF files.

Parsing & Tagging Module:

Clean the raw data (strip HTML, normalize text).

Auto-tag using predefined keywords with an option for LLM-based tagging later.

Storage Layer:

Use a relational database (Postgres via Supabase) with a schema that stores content and metadata (source, date, tags, etc.).

Arrange content in a folder-like structure by source or type.

MCP Server (Unified API Layer):

Developed in Python (e.g., using FastAPI) with an interface that exposes each function as an MCP “tool.”

Tools follow a JSON schema (name, description, parameter definitions) to allow standardized calls from AI models.

Frontend/Dashboard (Optional):

A web dashboard built with MERN/NextJS for manual exploration, export, and search.

Task Scheduling & Notification (Optional):

Use a task queue like Celery (with Redis) or system cron jobs for periodic data ingestion and generating daily/weekly summaries.

Integrate SMTP or a transactional email service (Mailgun/SendGrid) for notifications.

Security, Scalability & Privacy:

Secure storage of API keys, session cookies, and user data.

Use environment variables and containerization (Docker) to manage deployment securely.

Modular design for easy scaling (microservices architecture if required).

3. Core Functional Modules
<a name="ingestion"></a>

A. Data Ingestion
Sources to Cover:

Web Content / News:

WSJ & The Economist:

Techniques: Headless browsing with Playwright (powerful for sites with dynamic JavaScript) or REST APIs if available.

Libraries: Playwright (Python), BeautifulSoup with Requests for simpler, static pages.

Research Documents (ProQuest/Stanford Library):

File Processing: Automatically pull or allow manual upload of PDF documents.

Libraries: PyPDF2, pdfminer.six, or PyMuPDF for reliable PDF text extraction.

Twitter Feed:

Techniques: Use the official Twitter API via Tweepy for streaming or pull-based collection.

Functionality: Capture tweets (including replies, likes, retweets) with timestamps.

Tagging: Classify using predefined keyword sets or basic NLP; later, integrate lightweight LLM tagging.

Email Newsletters:

Techniques: Configure a dedicated email address; use Mailgun or Postmark APIs, or access Gmail via the Gmail API.

Parsing: Utilize Python’s built-in email library to extract subject, sender, body, and date.

Manual Primers / Uploads:

Techniques: Create endpoints in FastAPI for file upload.

Support: Accept plaintext files, markdown documents, and PDFs.

<a name="parsing"></a>

B. Parsing & Tagging
Content Cleaning:

Remove HTML using BeautifulSoup’s .get_text() method.

Normalize white space and correct encoding issues.

Tagging Implementation:

Initial: Use static keyword mapping for topics such as “economics,” “AI,” “geopolitics.”

Future Enhancement: Integrate a lightweight LLM via an API (OpenAI, Hugging Face) to generate tags dynamically.

Metadata Assignment:

Store source (e.g., "WSJ", "Twitter"), date (formatted as YYYY-MM-DD), tags (as array or JSONB field), and any authors or identifiers.

<a name="storage"></a>

C. Storage and Database
Database Choice:

Supabase/Postgres: Offers modern, open-source backend features with real-time subscriptions.

Schema Design:

Create a primary table for content with fields for ID, source, raw_content, clean_content, date, tags (as ARRAY or JSONB), and timestamps.

ORM:

Use SQLAlchemy (or Tortoise ORM if you prefer asynchronous operations with FastAPI).

<a name="mcp"></a>

D. MCP Server Interface & API Layer
Definition and Role of MCP:

MCP (Model Context Protocol): Standardizes how external LLMs request tools (functions) from your system.

Tools as Functions: Each functionality (search, listing, summarization) is exposed as a tool, with a defined name, description, and parameter schema formatted in JSON.

How Tools Are Exposed:

Example tool:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "search_content",
    "description": "Search content by keyword, date, and source.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "keyword": {"type": "string", "description": "Search keyword"},
        "start_date": {"type": "string", "description": "YYYY-MM-DD"},
        "end_date": {"type": "string", "description": "YYYY-MM-DD"},
        "source": {"type": "string", "description": "Filter by source (optional)"}
      },
      "required": ["keyword"]
    }
  }
}
Communication Protocol: Typically JSON-RPC–like. Requests include an ID, method (tool name), and parameters. The server responds with a result or error message.

Backend Implementation:

FastAPI is ideal for building a robust asynchronous server.

Define an endpoint (e.g., /mcp/call) that interprets tool calls and dispatches them to the proper function.

Error Handling and Logging:

Use Python’s logging module to track errors.

Implement clear error messages that adhere to MCP protocols.

<a name="frontend"></a>

E. Frontend/Dashboard (Optional)
Use Case:

Build a NextJS dashboard for visual exploration of aggregated data, full-text search, filtering, and export.

Tech: MERN stack (NextJS for frontend; Supabase/Postgres for backend).

<a name="scheduling"></a>

F. Task Scheduling & Notification
For Scheduled Ingestion and Digest Notifications:

Task Scheduler:

Use Celery with Redis as a message broker to schedule periodic tasks (or simple cron jobs if the workload is light).

Digest Notifications:

Compile daily/weekly summaries.

Send out via basic HTML email (using Mailgun, SendGrid, or Python’s smtplib).

<a name="technology"></a>

<a name="ingestion_impl"></a>

B. Implementing Data Ingestion Modules
Example – Web Scraping Module (WSJ/The Economist):

Use Playwright for dynamic websites:

python
Copy
Edit
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def scrape_article(url):
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto(url)
        # Wait for dynamic content if necessary, then extract article text
        content = page.content()
        # Use BeautifulSoup to parse and extract text
        from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
        soup = BeautifulSoup(content, "html.parser")
        text = soup.get_text(separator="\n")
        browser.close()
        return text
Example – Twitter Module with Tweepy:

Authenticate and fetch tweets:

python
Copy
Edit
import tweepy

def fetch_tweets(api_key, api_secret, access_token, access_token_secret):
    auth = tweepy.OAuth1UserHandler(api_key, api_secret, access_token, access_token_secret)
    api = tweepy.API(auth)
    tweets = api.home_timeline(count=20)
    return [tweet._json for tweet in tweets]
Example – Email Parsing Endpoint (using FastAPI):

Create an endpoint to receive emails (via webhook from Mailgun/Postmark):

python
Copy
Edit
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/email/webhook")
async def email_webhook(request: Request):
    email_data = await request.json()
    # Extract subject, body, sender, date from email_data
    # Process and store in the database
    return {"status": "received"}
<a name="parsing_impl"></a>

C. Developing Parsing and Tagging Modules
Content Cleaning:

Create helper functions using BeautifulSoup to strip HTML.

Auto-Tagging:

Write functions that search for keywords in the text.

Optionally integrate with an LLM API later on for smarter tagging.

<a name="db"></a>

D. Designing the Database Schema and Integrating Supabase
Schema Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE content (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    source VARCHAR(50),
    raw_content TEXT,
    clean_content TEXT,
    date DATE,
    tags TEXT[],
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
Integrate with SQLAlchemy in Python:

python
Copy
Edit
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Text, Date, TIMESTAMP, ARRAY
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@host/dbname"
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
Base = declarative_base()

class Content(Base):
    __tablename__ = "content"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    source = Column(String(50))
    raw_content = Column(Text)
    clean_content = Column(Text)
    date = Column(Date)
    tags = Column(ARRAY(String))
    created_at = Column(TIMESTAMP)
<a name="mcp_impl"></a>

E. Building an MCP Server with FastAPI
MCP Tool and Endpoint:

Define an endpoint that listens for MCP calls. Here is a simplified example:

python
Copy
Edit
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import json

app = FastAPI(title="MCP Server - Unified Intelligence Aggregator")

class MCPRequest(BaseModel):
    id: str
    method: str
    params: dict

class MCPResponse(BaseModel):
    id: str
    result: dict = None
    error: str = None

# Example tool: search_content
def search_content_tool(params):
    # Use SQLAlchemy query based on params to fetch matching content
    keyword = params.get("keyword")
    # For demonstration, return static content
    return {"found": [f"Article related to {keyword}", "More content here"]}

@app.post("/mcp/call", response_model=MCPResponse)
async def handle_mcp_call(request: MCPRequest):
    if request.method == "search_content":
        try:
            result = search_content_tool(request.params)
            return MCPResponse(id=request.id, result=result)
        except Exception as e:
            return MCPResponse(id=request.id, error=str(e))
    else:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Unknown tool")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run("mcp_server:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, reload=True)
This endpoint acts as your MCP server interface. Each tool (here, search_content) is defined with clear input parameters and a JSON response.

MCP Tool Format:

Ensure your tool definitions conform to MCP standards so that external LLMs can call your functions. Documentation and examples from awesome-mcp-servers can serve as guidance.

<a name="frontend_impl"></a>

F. Optional Frontend/Dashboard
Dashboard Technologies:

Use NextJS for building a responsive dashboard.

Integrate your FastAPI backend via REST or GraphQL.

Features:

View and search aggregated content.

Visualize summaries and notifications.

Interact with data (export, filter, and tag).

<a name="scheduling_impl"></a>

G. Optional Task Scheduling & Notifications
Scheduling:

Use Celery with Redis to schedule periodic data ingestion tasks.

Alternatively, use cron jobs if your data volume is low.

Notification Engine:

Write routines that compile the day’s (or week’s) data and generate HTML digests.

Send emails using Mailgun or SendGrid with proper HTML formatting.

<a name="deployment"></a>

6. Deployment and Security Considerations
Containerization:

Use Docker to containerize your application (both the FastAPI server and any auxiliary services like Redis/Celery).

Develop a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml for orchestration.

Security Best Practices:

Use environment variables to store sensitive information (database credentials, API keys).

Implement HTTPS in production.

Use authentication (API keys or OAuth2) for any endpoints exposed to external networks.

Regularly audit dependencies and use static code analysis tools.

Scalability:

The modular design allows you to scale individual components independently.

If load increases, consider deploying on Kubernetes or using serverless functions for specific ingestion tasks.

<a name="future"></a>

7. Future-Proofing, Extensions & Maintenance
Future Enhancements:

LLM-based Tagging and Summaries:

As LLM integration matures, replace keyword tagging with real-time context enrichment.

Additional MCP Tools:

Expand tools to support complex queries (e.g., “summarize recent economic articles”, “find tweets about inflation”).

Agent Integration:

Enable proactive notifications (RAG-style summarization) and even a Chrome extension for clipping web content.

Monitoring and Analytics:

Incorporate Prometheus/Grafana for real-time monitoring of server health and usage analytics.

Maintenance:

Use version control (Git) and CI/CD pipelines.

Write automated tests for every module, unit tests for ingestion and integration tests for MCP endpoints.

Document your API (using OpenAPI/Swagger documentation with FastAPI).
